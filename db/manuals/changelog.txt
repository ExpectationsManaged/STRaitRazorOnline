v0.1.3


v0.1.4
	-Added STRidER tab
	-STRidER input fields
	-Added CV to RAP batch output
	-Fixed bug affecting SNP loci with secondary SNP variant in matching sequence
	
	
	
	
	
	NEED TO DO
	Notes for v3 improvement
		DYS19 Changed motif matching to forward strand
		DYS389II 5x fixed previously by removing DYS389I bleedthrough (i.e., negative alleles)
		mh16-MC1RB	60x TGCTGGAGGC --> TGCTGGAGGCYGGT
		mh16-MC1RC	15x TGTCGTCTTC --> TGTCGTCTTCAGCA
		rs1800407	Adjusted offset from 69-->67
		
		Check negative loci filtering of actual deletions in SNP loci.

	UI mess
	LB- & SB-based bar plot [Note: Need to plot allele length with allele name overlay; LB only][All plots; really would like to have bounds of each locus == allele range] [Filter out DYS389II/I artifacts from v3]

Kinship
Database import
Expanded haplotype database (consistent with ForenSeq UAS & RR+Flank)
Stutter modeling? Autoflag Stutter? Stutter Calcs? Stutter Filtering?
Custom configs
Read merging
More ML work on haplotype LR
Private mutation nomenclature creation
Alignment?
IGV launcher
User accounts with saved defaults
Anything remotely resembling stutter [partially ready would be better if it were more dynamic]
Alleles not in a stutter flag [potential trace or contaminate]
Called stutter in Y-STRs need correcting (i.e., include max RAP to tag stutter calls)
